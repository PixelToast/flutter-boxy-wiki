# Introduction To Layout

When Flutter was created, it set out to provide a render architecture that was simple, performant, and modular. Compare this to [HTML](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/layoutng/) or Android [View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View)s, which have many complex, slow, and implementation-specific layout algorithms.

Most of the widgets you use in Flutter are actually pretty simple and elegant under the hood, there is rarely any magic, so try not to be intimidated by it!

### Constraints go down, Sizes go up

You can think of layout in Flutter as a bunch of functions that take in BoxConstraints and return a Size:

{% code title="(simplification)" %}
```dart
Size layout(BoxConstraints constraints) {
  final childSize = child.layout(BoxConstraints()));
  child.position(Offset.zero);
  return childSize;
}
```
{% endcode %}

This is called the [RenderBox](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderBox-class.html) protocol, it's simplicity is what enables animations in Flutter to outperform native Android, iOS, and web.

The downside of being simple is that developers have to put in a little extra effort to constrain widgets and avoid those pesky flex overflow, unbounded constraints, and infinite size errors.

The Flutter team made a great article on the design philosophy and performance implications of the RenderObject model: [https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/inside-flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/inside-flutter)

### Constrain all the things

There is a little terminology that can be useful for dealing with constraints or reading error messages:

BoxConstraints define a minimum and maximum length for each axis, by default BoxConstraints is **unconstrained** meaning the minimum width / height is 0, and the maximum is infinity.

* An axis is said to be <mark style="background-color:purple;">**tight**</mark> if the minimum and maximum is the same, e.g. `BoxConstraints(minWidth: 10.0, maxWidth: 10.0)` has a tight width. The child will not be able to size itself on that axis.
* An axis is said to be <mark style="background-color:purple;">**loose**</mark> if the minimum is 0. The child will be able to choose its size on that axis assuming the maximum is not also 0.
* An axis is said to be <mark style="background-color:purple;">**unbounded**</mark> if the maximum is infinity. The child will have to determine its own size on that axis, which can cause issues if the child wants to fill its available space.
* An axis is said to be <mark style="background-color:purple;">**unconstrained**</mark> if the the minimum is 0 and the maximum is infinity. Unbounded constraints are usually also unconstrained, the child can choose any size it wants.

#### Tight constraints example

SizedBox is an example of a way to provide tight constraints to a child:

```dart
SizedBox(
  width: 100,
  child: Text('My width is 100, no more, no less.'),
)
```

#### Loose constraints example

Center is a common way of loosening constraints:

```dart
SizedBox(
  width: 200,
  height: 200,
  child: Center(
    child: Text('I can be any size I want, as long as its < 200.'),
  ),
)
```

#### Unconstrained constraints example

The most common way things become unconstrained is if they are in some kind of list:

```dart
ListView(
  children: [
    Text('I have a constrained width, but an unconstrained height.'),
  ],
)
```

#### Quirks and Features ðŸš—

One notable quirk is that children are forced to follow the constraints given by their parent, which can be unintuitive sometimes:

```dart
SizedBox(
  width: 100,
  child: SizedBox(
    width: 200,
    child: Text('Is my width 100 or 200?'),
  ),
)
```

Do you think the width of this text is 100 or 200 pixels wide? If you chose 100, you are correct.

The implementation of [RenderConstrainedBox](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderConstrainedBox-class.html) reveals why:

```dart
child!.layout(_additionalConstraints.enforce(constraints), parentUsesSize: true);
```

### The many trees

Before creating our own [RenderObject](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html), we first need to understand the relationship between the Widget, Element, and Render trees.

![](.gitbook/assets/trees.png)

You are probably familiar with how [State](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html) works, it's a persistent instance that has methods you can override to know when to initialize, build, and dispose.

State is actually just a fancy delegate for [ComponentElement](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ComponentElement-class.html) so that Flutter doesn't have to expose its ugly internals, other than that Element and State are essentially the same thing!

Elements are also our [BuildContext](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildContext-class.html), the interface also exists to hide ugly internals.

The Element tree is formed by recursively calling [Widget.createElement](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Widget/createElement.html), Flutter does the dirty work of reactively mounting, building, reparenting, and unmounting them for you.

When [RenderObjectElement](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RenderObjectElement-class.html)s are mounted they call [RenderObjectWidget.createRenderObject](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RenderObjectWidget/createRenderObject.html) to create a [RenderObject](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html).

There is a different [Element](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Element-class.html) type depending on how children are structured, for example [ColoredBox](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ColoredBox-class.html) is a [SingleChildRenderObjectWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SingleChildRenderObjectWidget-class.html) that creates a [SingleChildRenderObjectElement](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SingleChildRenderObjectElement-class.html), and [Row](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html) is a [MultiChildRenderObjectWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MultiChildRenderObjectWidget-class.html) that creates a [MultiChildRenderObjectElement](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MultiChildRenderObjectElement-class.html).

{% hint style="info" %}
There is technically no such thing as a "widget tree", widgets are more like user-defined data structures that do not share a root node. The term is often conflated with the element tree, since elements form a global tree and provide context.
{% endhint %}

### Interactive Example

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

Here's a DartPad that you can play around with:

{% embed url="https://dartpad.dartlang.org/?id=0d12f9092860c0793e57eb3b9cad2926" %}
DartPad - [square-opacity.dart](https://gist.github.com/PixelToast/0d12f9092860c0793e57eb3b9cad2926)
{% endembed %}

It takes a child (Hello, World!) and ensures the height equals the width, the custom RenderObject also animates opacity to show how [Layer](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/Layer-class.html)s work.

The actual layout algorithm itself is quite simple, the annoying part is just the amount of boilerplate:

1. Subclass [LeafRenderObjectWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LeafRenderObjectWidget-class.html), [SingleChildRenderObjectWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SingleChildRenderObjectWidget-class.html), or [MultiChildRenderObjectWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MultiChildRenderObjectWidget-class.html)
2. Implement [createRenderObject](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RenderObjectWidget/createRenderObject.html) / [updateRenderObject](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RenderObjectWidget/updateRenderObject.html) to pass variables to your RenderObject
3. Subclass [RenderBox](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderBox-class.html)
4. Mix in [RenderObjectWithChildMixin](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObjectWithChildMixin-mixin.html), [ContainerRenderObjectMixin](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/ContainerRenderObjectMixin-mixin.html), or [SlottedContainerRenderObjectMixin](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SlottedContainerRenderObjectMixin-mixin.html)
5. Implement setters to check and call [markNeedsPaint](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject/markNeedsPaint.html) or [markNeedsLayout](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject/markNeedsLayout.html)
6. Implement [performLayout](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderBox/performLayout.html)
7. Implement [paint](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject/paint.html)

The original goal of Boxy was to boil this down into a simple, intuitive delegate class, sort of like a [CustomPainter](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/CustomPainter-class.html) on steroids.
