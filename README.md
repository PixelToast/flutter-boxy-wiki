Boxy is a Flutter package created to overcome the limitations of built-in layout widgets, it provides utilities for flex, custom multi-child layouts, dynamic widget inflation, slivers, and more!

It has excellent documentation, test coverage, passes strict analysis rules, and is used in a couple of production apps with great success.
